# Kaggle Intro Competitions 

This repository contains my solutions to Kaggle's introductory competitions (e.g., Titanic, House Prices).  
Each project covers basic EDA, feature engineering, and model building with scikit-learn and LightGBM.  
The goal is to practice end-to-end ML workflows and build a solid foundation for more advanced challenges.
